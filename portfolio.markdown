## Book Club

[Book Club]({% link book-club.markdown %}) was my mod 3 group project, and won Turing's Demo Comp for our team!

It is a web app where users can: 

- search for books
- create a club
- invite other users
- start discussions within the club about a specific book

Book Club won Turing's Demo Comp, even when competing from a relatively weak position of being "only" in mod 3, competing against mod 4 projects.

## Mugen DB

[Mugen DB]({% link mugen-db.markdown %}) was an enjoyable solo project in which I guilt a separated front-end/back-end game engine to support host resources and information for players of a game called [MUGEN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mugen_(game_engine)).

I implemented AWS S3, dealt with uploading images (from a separate front-end) and storing/saving them in a separate backend.

## Sweater Weather

[Sweater Weather](({% link sweater-weather.markdown %})) was a solo mod 3 project, with learning outcomes around sending/receiving data with third-party APIs, and authentication/authorization basics.

I built a Rails API-only backend with endpoints exposing data relating to current and forecasted weather at destinations provided by the user.

## Flash Cards

[Flash Cards](({% link flash-cards.markdown %})) was my first group project at Turing, very fun for a brand-new early-career software developer.

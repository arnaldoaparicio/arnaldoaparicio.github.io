# Book Club

Book club was a mod 3 group project, that won Turing's Demo Comp for our team!

It is a web app where users can: 

- search for books
- create a club
- invite other users
- start discussions within the club about a specific book

Book Club won Turing's Demo Comp, even when competing from a relatively weak position of being "only" in mod 3, competing against mod 4 projects.

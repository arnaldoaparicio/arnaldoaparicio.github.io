# Sweather Weather API

## Context

Sweater Weather was a solo mod 3 project, with learning outcomes around sending/receiving data with third-party APIs, and authentication/authorization basics.

I built a Rails API-only backend with endpoints exposing data relating to current and forecasted weather at destinations provided by the user.

## Focus Areas

- Fetch data from multiple external APIs
- exposing API endpoints requiring an authentication token.

## Timeline

- 1 Week

## Technologies

- Ruby
- Rails
- PostgreSQL
- VCR (mocking tool)
- RSpec
- MapQuest's Geocoding API
- OpenWeather One Call API

## Links

API requests were sent using Postman

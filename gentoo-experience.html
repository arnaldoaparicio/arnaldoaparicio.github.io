' ao go all in on Gentoo and install it on my laptop.
    Was this reckless for a linux novice such as myself? Perhaps but I'm up for a challenge.
    One of the things I heard was that the installation for Gentoo takes FOREVER. I downplayed that part. I wish I listened.

    The biggest issue I was facing was getting my graphics processor to work. I did a stress test on my machine by running a game on the PCSX2 and found that performance was atrocious. It lagged, it was slow. Stuttered too much. After I was 
    finally able to get it working, it ran as smooth as butter.

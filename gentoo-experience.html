<p> I've been a longtime Windows user, dating back to the mid 2000s and I've also been an avid Mac user for the past several years.
    Recently, I decided to jump into Linux. I've known about Linux for years but never really looking into it. 
    One day, I decided to look for distros and I managed to install PopOS on a spare laptop I had. It was a very enjoyable experience and I picked up on it quick.
    While looking for tips and tricks regarding PopOS on Youtube, I stumbled upon Gentoo. Someone had made a video reviewing it and it piqued my interest.
     A big part of the appeal to me is how highly customizable Gentoo is and how the user has complete control of their system.
    But there's a catch. It is notoriously difficult to set up and install. But I decided to install It on my laptop anyways.
    Was this reckless for a linux novice such as myself? Perhaps but I'm up for a challenge.
    One of the things I heard was that the installation for Gentoo takes FOREVER. I downplayed that part. I wish I listened.

    Looking back, I would say that it took me

    The biggest issue I was facing was getting my graphics processor to work. I did a stress test on my machine by running a game on the PCSX2 and found that performance was atrocious. It lagged, it was slow. Stuttered too much. After I was 
    finally able to get it working, it ran as smooth as butter.

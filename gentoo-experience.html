<p>My Gentoo Experience</p>
<p>I have been a Windows user for a majority of my life. When I went to Turing in 2021, a Macbook was sent to me for school work and I have been using MacOS regularly ever since. 
    At some point, I decided to use Linux, more specifically PopOS, and became enamored by it ever since. Then I heard about Gentoo. The selling point to me was how it was highly customizable and you only install what YOU NEED.
    While it's highly customizable, there's a steep learning curve. I wasn't sure if I wanted to take the plunge given how little I knew about Linux and the time investment in order to get it working (more on that later).
    I've heard about how difficult it was to install Arch Linux (btw i don't use Arch), so I was really dreading Gentoo.
    After thinking about it for about a week and a half, I decided to go all in on Gentoo and install it on my laptop.
    Was this reckless for a linux novice such as myself? Perhaps but I'm up for a challenge.
    One of the things I heard was that the installation for Gentoo takes FOREVER. I downplayed that part. I wish I listened.

# MUGEN DB

Mugen DB was an enjoyable solo project in which I guilt a game engine to support host resources and information for players of a game called [MUGEN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mugen_(game_engine)).

## Focus Areas

- Implement Amazon S3
- upload images to Amazon S3 bucket
- create user based submissions
- display uploaded images

## Technologies

- Ruby/Rails
- Amazon S3
- PostgreSQL
- fly.io

## Context

This project was created to implement image uploading with Amazon S3 to an app that consists of a Rails API backend and a Rails frontend. 

Currently, only a registered admin is allowed to publish content.

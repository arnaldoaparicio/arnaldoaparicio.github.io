    <p>[Solo Project]</p>
    <p>A web app that hosts various links to resources for the game engine called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mugen_(game_engine)">MUGEN</a>.</p>
    <p>Focus Areas: Implement Amazon S3, upload images to Amazon S3 bucket, create user based submissions, display uploaded images</p>
    <p>Timeline: 2 weeks (ongoing)</p>
    <p>Technologies: Ruby, Rails, Amazon S3, HTML, PostgreSQL, fly.io</p>
    <p>Context: This project was created to implement image uploading with Amazon S3 to an app that consists of a Rails API backend
        and a Rails frontend. This is still an ongoing project but its core functionality is complete. All that is left is to stylize 
        the frontend and add proper user permissions in regards to submissions.

Hi, I'm Arnaldo!

A former head baker turned software engineer trying to figure out his surroundings.

When I'm not programming, I'm engaged in other activities such as:

- Tinkering with Gentoo linux <i style="font-size: 45px" class="devicon-gentoo-plain colored"></i>
- Yoga
- Video Games (currently playing Cuphead)
- Taking long walks and soaking in nature
- Occasionally baking

You can check out my [portfolio]({% link portfolio.markdown %}) to see my work.

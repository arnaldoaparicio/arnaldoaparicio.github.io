Hi, I'm Arnaldo!

A former head baker turned software engineer.

When I'm not programming, I'm engaged in other activities such as:

- Tinkering with EndeavourOS
- Yoga
- Video Games (looking forward to 'Tears of the Kingdom')
- Gardening (despite having a clear thumb, not green)
- Taking long walks and soaking in nature
- Occasionally baking

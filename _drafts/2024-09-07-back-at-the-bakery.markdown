title: "Back at working as a baker?"

My first job was being a baker at a local bakery called Century Bakery. I first started as a baker's helper right after I graduated high school. Towards the end of my run, I became the head baker.

Eventually, I decided to leave my position as head baker to go back to school full time to become a software developer. But a few years later, I was compelled to go back to Century Bakery. 

One thing that didn't help much is the job market. It has been very tumultuous. I eventually decided that I really wanted to go back to Century Bakery.

One reason I went back is I wanted to see if I could perform at a high level. While I did work as a caregiver at my friend's doggy daycamp, it wasn't very challenging and I really wanted to test my wits and intuition. I had heard there was an opening at Century Bakery and I decided to jump back into that part of my world once again.  Another reason is that I had learned that the team was in need of some help and I figured I could go back and help out to help elevate the business. I was doing some prep work, very light work. I was ready to sink my teeth but the opportunities weren't there....yet.

My specialty was donuts and there was already a donut guy. It had been over 3 years since I made any kind of donut. But then one day the donut guy quit. There was a void to fill and there was my chance to truly challenge myself. Without any refresher, I was able to make donuts at a very high level, improving the quality, increasing the yield, and cutting back on food waste. 

The software developer dream is NOT dead and my return as a baker has increased my confidence and I'm ready to show the world I can knock it out of the park, catch the ball, and run around again.

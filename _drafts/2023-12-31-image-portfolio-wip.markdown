So what's been going on lately? I recently inspiration to create another app in Rails.

This time, it's a photography portfolio. I took a bunch of pictures of stuff over the years but I haven't uploaded most of them. Not only is this a great refresher for me in terms of working with Rails monoliths, but it gives me an excuse for me to show people my pictures. 

None of them are gonna win any awards but it's another view of the world from my lens.

Here's a preview of what I created
